```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# install.packages(c("smatr", "here"))
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(smatr)
```

## Using RMD files

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Alternativly, you can click on the green play button next to each chunk to run each chunk locally. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biomass_data <- read_csv("data/biomass_conversions.csv")
```

One _very_ minor caveat of RMD is that they mess up file paths in a R project.

```{r bad RMD, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output/png/RMD_filepath_error.png"), error=TRUE)
```

So we have to rely on the `here` R package to tell R/RMD where the heck we are working from. Run this code chunk to install and load the `here`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("here")

library(here)
```

The `here()` function will spit out the absolute file path to your project without you having to type it out. 

```{r}
here()
```

### Read in data

We can use it in RMD code chunks so we can read in data and images smoothly! 

Also noticed I am used `read_csv()`? `read_csv()` is the tidyverse cousin of `read.csv()`. The benefit of using this version is a much tidier output!

```{r, warning=FALSE}
biomass_data <- read_csv(here("data/biomass_conversions.csv"))
```

### Overview of data

```{r}
str(biomass_data)
skim(biomass_data)
```

### Filter Frozen Samples

```{r}
biomass_data_frozen <- biomass_data %>%
  filter(`Preservation Method` == "Frozen")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
